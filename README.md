## Retired ELIXIR Beacon Project website

This is the deprecated version of the main Beacon website code, where the site
has been accessed through the <https://beacon-project.io> link.

Since August 2024 the code has been moved to <https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/ga4gh-beacon.github.io>.

The main information site for the ELIXIR Beacon Project - i.e. the formatted content of this repository - can be accessed as [Beacon website](http://genomebeacons.org/). Detailed information about the Beacon technology can be found in the [Beacon v2 code repository](http://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/) and on the [API documentation site](http://docs.genomebeacons.org).

For more information about the project you may also consult the corresponding [ELIXIR website](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/beacons).
