### 2020-01-13: Beacon Compliance TC

##### Johan Viklund, Malin Klang, Andreas Kähäri, Michael Baudis, Marta Ferri

#### Agenda

* Current [test suite](https://github.com/NBISweden/beacon-api-tests) status.
* How is test data stored and loaded into a beacon.

#### Todo

* Format of test data.
    - Define individual call sets (i.e. a variant that is twice should be twice in test data)
* How to interpret the API. Different sites have had different interpretation on how queries and the response should be formatted. We need to go through these and agree.
* Structure tests into different classes.
* How new queries are added to the API and compliance tests - to be discussed in a bigger setting.
