We're proud to host the next Spring GA4GH Connect meeting in April 2024 at the
_Congressi Stefano Franscini_ on the Monte Verit√† in Ascona. This will provide an
excellent opportunity for Swiss genomics and bioinformatics to, well, connect with
the international "genomics and health" community and projects.
