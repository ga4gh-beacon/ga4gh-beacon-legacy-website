#### Michael Baudis

The Beacon Sessions at GA4GH Connect November 2022 targeted the migration of existing and
implementation of new **v2** Beacons, with emphasis on the "how to get there easily" rather
than on all Beacon v2 features.<!--more-->

The slides here represent the introductory and "Michael's view" part of the 2x 90min sessions,
with additional material being presented by other "beaconeers" and a lot of discussions happening.
