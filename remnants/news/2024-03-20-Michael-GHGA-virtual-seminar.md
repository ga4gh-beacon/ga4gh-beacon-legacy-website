With the ever increasing amount of genomic data produced in the context of research studies, population analyses and medical diagnostics the need for access to genomic information beyond administrative or geographic boundaries has become a matter of eminent importance. <!--more-->
Here, the Beacon standard by the Global Alliance for Genomics an Health (GA4GH) has emerged as the major protocol for federated genomic data discovery with potential for implementation in different environments, from research nodes to international networks.

Professor Michael Baudis will present the history and trajectory of the Beacon protocol as well as discuss it in the context of GA4GH and ELIXIR standards and potential deployment options for genomics resources, Beacon networks and aggregators.
