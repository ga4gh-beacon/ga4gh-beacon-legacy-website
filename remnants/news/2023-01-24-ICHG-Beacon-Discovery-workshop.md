These Hands-on workshops will take place on February the 26th and 27th, in the framework of the [International Congress of Human Genetics (ICHG)](https://www.ichg2023.com/), that is being held in Cape Town from February 22 – 26.

The training courses aim to provide knowledge about what is Beacon, how was it developed and which are the three different scenarios that can be faced by an institution that wants to deploy a Beacon. 

#### 26th February: "How to make sensitive data discoverable", hosted by the CINECA project

This training course will take place within the framework of the ["Federated data analysis workshop"](https://www.cineca-project.eu/news-events-all/federated-data-analysis-workshop), organised by the CINECA project.
The workshop, provided in this occasion by Mamana Mbiyavanga (H3Africa, UCT, South Africa), Mauricio Moldes (European Genome-phenome Archive, CRG, Barcelona, Spain) and Coline Thomas (European Genome-phenome Archive, EMBL, Hixton, United Kingdom), will share with the participants three queries to try the Beacon potential. You can try one of them from your computer too: 
- ["Do we see the variant A > G in position 160500074?"](https://ega-archive.org/beacon-apis/cineca/g_variants/?start=16050074&end=16050075&alternateBases=G&referenceBases=A)

#### 27th February: “Technical implementation of GA4GH standards for data discoverability. Tools and techniques to make sensitive data discoverable”, in collaboration with the H3ABioNet
This workshop is intended for [H3Africa](https://h3africa.org/) technical members. Organised by Mamana Mbiyavanga (H3Africa, UCT, South Africa), Mauricio Moldes (European Genome-phenome Archive, CRG, Barcelona, Spain), Nicola Mulder (H3Africa, UCT, South Africa) and Sumr Panji (H3Africa, UCT, South Africa), in collaboration with the [Pan African Bioinformatics Network for the H3Africa consortium (H3ABioNet)](https://h3abionet.org/), the session will focus on the technical side of the Beacon deployment. 

#### The current Beacon V2 Reference Implementation (B2RI) 
The B2RI is a free opensource software package that includes tools for lighting up a Beacon out-of-the-box. You can read more about in the [Beacon V2 Reference Implementation (B2RI) paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/19/4656/6671215?login=false), as it is now open access to know more about this set of tools that enables federated sharing of genomic and phenotypic data.

#### About the International Congress of Human Genetics
Hosted by the [African Society of Human Genetics (AfSHG)](https://www.afshg.org/) and the [Southern African Society for Human Genetics (SASHG)](https://sashg.org/), the International Congress of Human Genetics reunite international experts to highlight how genomic technologies are being managed to address challenges generated by the current status of Human Health and Genomics.
