   "description" : "The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Accepted \nvalues: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any \nbase, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a \npartially known sequence. For example a sequence where the first and \nlast bases are known, but the middle portion can exhibit countless \nvariations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: ANNT the Ns can take \ntake any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT (or any \nother combination) viable sequences.\nSymbolic ALT alleles (DEL, INS, DUP, INV, CNV, DUP:TANDEM, DEL:ME,\nINS:ME) will be represented in `variantType`.\nOptional: either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.\n",
