<h2>{{page.title}}</h2>

The Zurich meeting is intended to align the current development version of the Beacon API and the Beacon+ driver, and to improve the documentation structure of the Beacon project.

In another part of the 2-days meeting we will explore further the concept and possible implementation of "Evidence Beacons", together with developers from the SVIP project.

The tentative agenda for the meeting is linked below.
