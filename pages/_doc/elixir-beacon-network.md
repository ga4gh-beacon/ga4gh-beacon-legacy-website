Beacon networks consist of registries of multiple Beacons, in different locations, which can be queried through a common interface or gateway protocol.

The _ELIXIR Beacon Network_ is a collection of Beacons from ELIXIR nodes, which - among other features - implement controlled access options by leveraging the <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai">[ELIXIR AAI]</a>.

An implementation of the ELIXIR Beacon Network has been launched in 2019 and is available <a href="https://beacon-network.elixir-europe.org" target="_blank">[here]</a>.

For the future - and especially with view on the planned Beacon v2 extensions - we expect to expand the network inside but also beyond ELIXIR member organisations.
